% INPUT:
%   HSI_noisy: noisy hyperspectral image of size n1*n2*n3 normalized to [0,1]
%   params: an option structure whose fields are as follows:           
%       alpha: radius of l_1 ball for sparse noise
%       beta: radius of l_1 ball for stripe noise
%       epsilon: radius of l_2 ball serving data-fidelity
%       omega: balancing parameter between 
%           first- and second-order differences
%       max_iter: maximum number of iterations
%       stop_cri: stopping criterion of P-PDS
%       dispiter: Period to display intermediate results
% OUTPUT:
%   restored_HSI: denoised hyperspectral image
%   removed_noise: removed noise
%   iteration: number of P-PDS iteration
